# My neovim config

This is my current and most minimal setup to date

## Why

I have always kept a rather big config, but with slow performance.
This however, limits what I have, while still having way more than i need
Also, i now use blink-cmp instead of nvim-cmp

## Plugins

* Autopairs: adds closing pair brackets
* Bigfile: Avoid highlightin too big files
* Blink-cmp: Completions
* Conform: formatter
* Dressing
* FZF: finder
* kanagawa: could be renamed to theme.lua
* lsp: The core that gives you all the power
* neotree: file explorer 
* nvim-treesitter:
* oil.lua: edit directories as a vim buffer
* project.lua, unsure
* sleuth-vim: unsure
* statusline: statusline at the bottom
* todo-comments: highlight TODO, FIX, NOTE, FIXME and so on
